# nodejwt

###### I have here used MongoDB to save data
###### I tried to create sample registration , login with jwt and one sample api that uses jwt.

###### Few steps to run this project
``` 
1. install node_modules : npm install
2. Run Project : npm start
```

###### Used Npm packages and brief details for it
1. **mongoose** : Mongoose provides a straight-forward, schema-based solution to model your application data. 
2. **jsonwebtoken** : To generate jwt token.
3. **dotenv** : Storing configuration in the environment separate from code 
4. **express** : Express is a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set                  of features for web and mobile applications.
5. **bycrptjs** : used to generate has key password 
6. **nodemon** : nodemon is a tool that helps develop node.js based applications by automatically restarting                     the node application when file changes in the directory are detected.
7. **@hapi/joi** : Validate data before we process for save (Currently , I have not used. Insted of it, I have                  used mongoose inbuilt validator)
